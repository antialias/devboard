## Installation & Setup

Firstly you'll need devcards itself.

```sh
npm install devcards --save-dev
```

And then you'll need wire it into your application / build system. The module itself aims to remain agnostic of build systems, so you do need a bit of plumbing here. As the system matures perhaps it will make sense to wrap these up into additional related modules.

## Usage

## Example

One of the best ways to see what Devcards is about is to experience it.

You can see the hosted example at http://glenjamin.github.io/devcards-js/ - each page has a link to the source which generates it.

However, the real power is the feedback when making live changes. To see this in action you can run the example on your local machine

```sh
cd example
npm install
npm start
```
